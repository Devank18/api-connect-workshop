# Create, deploy and test a new API using the API Connect Developer Toolkit
In this [lab](https://github.com/IBM/api-connect-workshop/blob/main/lab.md) you will create a new API using the OpenAPI definition of an existing RESTful web-service that gets realtime stock quotes. You will then test the API by deploying it in the Developer Portal. The app uses the API definition that you will create to get realtime stock quotes.

The following diagram shows the workflow steps that needs to be completed before sharing the APIs.
